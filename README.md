# Greeting assignment
This is a "open assingment" meaning that you may write it in any way you want as long as it meets the requirements.

## Problem Description
* Write a program that collects the user's name and another piece of information (your choice). 
* Print a message that uses both of those inputs.


## Suggested Approach
1) Collect each input separately and assign them to their own variables.
2) Decide how you want to connect the inputs with the greeting. Do you want to put them together before printing them, or inside the print() function?
3) Be aware of data types. Input values are strings by default. Consider whether you need to change them or not.
4) Remember that data types must be the same to be joined.
